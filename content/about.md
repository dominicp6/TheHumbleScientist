Hi, I'm Dominic! I am a science Ph.D. student based in Edinburgh, UK. I work with computational tools to make the multi-billion dollar drug development endeavor more efficient. I research combining traditional statistical mechanics with cutting-edge AI models to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations of complex proteins. 

This blog is where I share my academic insights and curiosities, providing an accessible and efficient way for students and researchers alike to learn. The themes that unite my research are probability, statistics, and dynamical systems. In this blog, I explore how these tools can help us understand complex systems and occasionally divulge some of my more informal academic musings!

Whether you are a fellow researcher, student, or just curious about the wanderings of a Humble Scientist, I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery. You can also check out my Google Scholar page for more information on my research. Stay tuned!
